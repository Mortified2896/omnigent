# Agent guidance

Guidance for AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) working in this
repository. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full contributor workflow.

## Control Room deployment safety — hard invariant

For the Control Room HomeLab O1/O2 deployment, read
`deploy/docs/control-room-dual-instance-upgrade-safety.md` before any deployment,
promotion, rollback, runtime replacement, service restart, or migration task.

The non-negotiable rule is:

> **Never let an Omnigent instance upgrade itself. O1 upgrades O2; O2 upgrades
> O1. The healthy peer stays alive and supervises the entire operation.**

Before any deployment, explicitly identify the target and supervisor. The only
valid normal pairs are:

- target O2 -> supervisor O1
- target O1 -> supervisor O2

If target == supervisor, STOP. Do not work around this with a detached
self-update executor. Detached executors are emergency recovery tools only.

Additional Control Room requirements:

- both instances ultimately track the same authoritative `main` lineage;
- O2 receives a candidate first; after acceptance/soak, O2 supervises promotion
  of the exact accepted immutable artifact to O1;
- do not rebuild the accepted artifact during O1 promotion;
- privileged deployment actions belong in a narrowly scoped host-level deployer,
  not by weakening the Omnigent service sandbox;
- preflight must complete before destructive mutation;
- rollback cleanup may delete only paths explicitly created by that same
  deployment transaction;
- application and database rollback must remain paired;
- if another promotion/rollback executor may still be active, STOP and inspect
  it before starting anything else.

This safety section overrides less-specific deployment wording elsewhere in the
repository.

## Committing

Run the `pre-commit` hook before committing (`pre-commit run --all-files`, or
let it run on staged files via `git commit`). Fix any issues it reports so the
commit lands clean — CI runs the same checks.

## Local development shortcuts

Use `just` for common tasks; run `just --list` for grouped recipes.

- `just ensure` — install/check prerequisites
- `just run-ios` / `just run-android` — build/run mobile apps
- `just dev` / `just dev-mobile` — start the omnigent dev pod
- `just electron-dev` / `just electron-build` — Electron desktop shell
- `just lint` / `just lint-all` — run pre-commit
- `just normalize-locks` — rewrite lockfile registries to PyPI/npmjs.org

## Pull requests

When you open a pull request, fill in the repo's PR template at
`.github/pull_request_template.md` (case-sensitive on Linux — note the lowercase
filename). Keep every section and checkbox row so reviewers can skim them.

- **Summary** — what changed and why.
- **Test Plan** — how you verified it.
- **Demo** — a **video or images** showing the change. Expected on contributor
  PRs for UI / frontend changes (check the "UI / frontend change" box under
  *Type of change*) so reviewers can see the new behaviour without checking out
  the branch. Use `N/A` for non-visual changes.
- **Type of change** / **Test coverage** — check all that apply (at least one
  each).
- **Coverage notes** — required if you checked "Manual verification completed"
  or "Not applicable".

Generate the description from the actual diff and this session's context — lead
with the motivation, then the change. Don't pass a `--body` that skips these
sections.

## Finishing a task

When you finish a task, print instructions to the user on how to test it: the
commands to run, the inputs to provide, or the steps to reproduce so they can
verify the result themselves. Don't leave the user guessing how to confirm the
work — tell them exactly what to do.

## Deprecating features

When deprecating a feature, note the version in which it is expected to be
removed so we can clean it up when that version ships. Call out the deprecation
version in code (e.g. a `@deprecated` tag or comment naming the target release)
and in the PR/commit description, so there's a clear marker to act on later.

## Code comments

Keep comments short and focused on the code, not on the change history.

- **Keep them brief** — prefer one or two lines. Avoid comments longer than
  three lines; if you need more, the code likely needs refactoring or a doc
  string, not a wall of inline commentary.
- **Describe the scenario, not the PR** — explain *what* the code handles or
  *why* it exists, in terms a future reader needs. Don't reference PR numbers,
  issue numbers, or ticket IDs (e.g. `#1646`, `fixes JIRA-123`); the scenario
  should be clear without chasing external links.

## Database query names

Application stores use `make_named_managed_session_maker` and give every
session a stable semantic operation name. The session-level name must describe
the caller's intent rather than repeat SQL syntax; use a nested
`query_name_scope` only when one transaction needs distinct names for important
subqueries. Because the named session covers implicit flush and commit, don't
add an explicit `flush()` only to make a query name observable.

## Framework-owned instructions

Keep runtime lifecycle and metadata instructions separate from portable agent
instructions:

- Agent-spec and per-request instructions are user-authored. Framework-owned
  instructions are additive runtime behavior and are appended after them in
  `omnigent/runtime/prompt.py`.
- Keep the canonical instruction text and lifecycle gate in the owning framework
  module. Harness adapters should only transport the composed instructions; do
  not duplicate policy across adapters or add lifecycle metadata to `AgentSpec`.
- If framework instructions grow beyond a small ordered list, introduce a
  structured `FrameworkInstructions` value at the prompt-composition boundary.
